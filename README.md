# Hypno's Lullaby Fix

This is an edit of FNF Hypno's Lullaby V2. The changes are:
- New option to turn off shaders (Frostbite shaders were too much for my laptop)
- New option for FC modes: If you select one and drop below that ranking, you must restart
- New option for Pendulum FC: If you miss hitting the pendulum, you must restart
- All images have been optimized to take up less space
- Crash and bug fixes, most importantly from Pussy Mode and Game Over screens
- Song position should be more accurate
- Hell Mode removed cause it's unfinished

I'm not planning on adding more stuff or making it compile to web/mobile, this was made mostly just so I could play through the mod (and not use web versions).

Also, I know the pause menu is broken... but I don't really wanna spend time trying to understand its code.
